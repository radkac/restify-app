# Endpoints monitoring service
### Exercise for [Applifting](https://www.applifting.cz/)

## Application
Application is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and framework [Restify](http://restify.com) (middleware for building REST APIs). It contains service for monitoring URLs on background and log status codes with payload. 

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Node 8.x** and **NPM** installed.

## Quick start
1. Clone the project from this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Import database to your localhost from ./db.sql (located in project root)
4. In the project root, rename file called `env-example.json` to `env-local.json`
5. In this file rewrite database credentials and other parameters with your own
6. Open http://localhost:3456

## Conclusion
This is my very first application in Node.js, but I really enjoyed work in this exercise. There were many problems, that I have to solve, but now, when it's done, I'm so satisfied with my work. Of course, there are many improvements and I'll do it better next time :)
